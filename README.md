## 👓 Specification
> [!NOTE]
> In this specification, we refer to words, characters, spaces, lines, etc. as **_tokens_** for simplicity.

There may be slight variations between the counts generated by Tally and other word counters due to differences in how they are implemented.

The counting function is implemented as a single-pass parser for performance reasons. State transitions (sentence terminator -> letter, letter -> space, etc.) are used to determine when to increment the counts for each token type.

The following characters are used to separate tokens:
- **Space:** `' '`
- **Newline:** `\n`
- **End Mark:** `.`, `!`, `?`

**End of Input** can also be considered a separator because words, sentences, paragraphs, and lines at the end of the input are counted even if not specifically terminated. For example, `Something` is counted as a word, sentence, paragraph, and line.

Here is an overview of how we determine the counts for each token type:

| Count Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **character** | A Unicode **grapheme cluster** (user-perceived character), as determined by `Intl.Segmenter`. This is currently hardcoded to use the `en` locale, but other locales may work as well. Using this method, Emojis and other multi-codepoint characters are counted as a single character. **Examples:** `a`, `2`, `!`, `🔥`, `貓` |
| **word**      | A contiguous sequence of one or more **letters or digits** followed by a **space**, **end mark**, or **newline**. Symbols by themselves are not considered words. **Examples:** `space `, `Whoa!`, `newline\n`, `42`.                                                                                                          |
| **sentence**  | A contiguous sequence of one or more **words** followed by an **end mark**. **Example:** `Hello, world!`, `20 93.`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **paragraph** | A contiguous sequence of one or more **sentences** followed by a **newline**. **Examples:** `The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog\n`, `Hello world! Bye world!\n`, `42\n`.                                                                                                                                              |
| **space**     | A literal space character (`' '`). Other whitespace (ex. tabs, newlines) are not included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **letter**    | A character in the ASCII ranges A–Z or a–z. **Examples:** `A`, `j`, `z`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **digit**     | A character in the ASCII range 0-9. **Examples:** `0`, `5`, `9`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **symbol**    | A non-letter, non-digit, non-space, non-newline character. This includes emojis, symbols, punctuation, and most whitespace. **Examples:** `,`, `%`, `#`, `😊`, `貓`, `\t`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **line**      | A literal newline character (`\n`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
